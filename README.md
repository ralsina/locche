locche
======

locche is an untouchable pastebin.

You can start using it from http://tinyurl.com/locche1

Some neat features:

* You can hack Locche inside Locche.
* You can go back to previous versions of the text (or Locche) from any copy of Locche
* It uses no server whatsoever (other than a CDN to get JS and codemirror)

What's missing?

* Making it pretty
* Shorten history URLs so the size doesn't explode so much
* Fix handling of ' " and probably other characters in the text
* Document it
